# Data structures and algorithms

This repository contains examples of data structures and algortihams from my college class.

## Sorting algorithams

Sorting algorithms learned and their complexity in big O notation.

| Algorithm | Complexity (average) |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| Quick sort | O(n*log(n)) |
| Bubble sort | O(n^2) |
| Selection sort | O(n^2) |
| Merge sort | O(n*log(n)) |
| Insertion sort | O(n^2) |
| Heap sort | O(n*log(n)) |

## Data structures

Data structures learned.

| Data structure |
| -------------- |

| Doubly linked list |
| Stack |
| Queue |
| Hash table |
| Binary search tree |

## Basic algorithms on graphs

Algorithms on graphs learned.

| Algorithm |
